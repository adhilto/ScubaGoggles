If an error similar to the one below appears: 
```
command not found: scubagoggles
```

Ensure that you have properly [configured the virtual environment](#installing-in-a-virtual-environment) and have activated the virtual environment using the OS appropriate commands. 

Alternatively, to run scubagoggles without installing it as a package, you can replace the `scubagoggles` command with `python scuba.py`.
