### Authentication

ScubaGoggles supports both OAuth and Service Accounts for authorization/authentication.
OAuth requires regular user consent while using a service account allows for more automation.
Follow the instructions below for the authentication method of your choice.

<!-- TODO discuss pros/cons of each method -->
