# Review Output
## Locating the Output
By default, ScubaGoggles output will be saved in a folder within the current working directory named GWSBaselineConformance_[yyyy_mm_dd_hh_mm_ss], though both the location of the output and name of the folder can be configured via the `--outputpath` and `--outputfoldername` parameters, respectively.

Unless run with the `--quiet` parameter, the HTML report will open automatically using the system's default browser.

## Output Format
The output will be saved in both HTML and json formats. See [Sample Report](/sample-report) for an example of the output.
